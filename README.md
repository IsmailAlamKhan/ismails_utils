# Ismail's Utils

Some utils that I use on my projects.

To use, add this to your pubspec.yaml

```yaml
  ismails_utils:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/IsmailAlamKhan/ismails_utils.git
```

To use the analysis options I use add the following to your analysis_options.yaml
```yaml
include: package:ismails_utils/analysis_options.yaml
```

To only use the analysis options look at https://github.com/IsmailAlamKhan/my_analysis_options
